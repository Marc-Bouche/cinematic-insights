Movie_Recommandation_System<br>
<br> 
Based on a combination of an existing dataframe and API ressources from oMBD, the API website from (iMBD) we are trying to identify the most commercially successful genre and optimal runtime for a new movie to be released in the near future, given current audience preferences and market trends .<br>

After the elaboration of th business question we came up with the 3 following hypothesis, that will be accepted or rejected, after our analysis:<br>

H1:Genre Popularity:<br>
'Genres with higher average ratings and vote counts in the past 10 years will likely be more successful in terms of box office earnings’<br>

H2:Audience Trends:<br>
'There is a correlation between a movie's financial success and the popularity of its featured actors.<br>

H3: Runtime Preference:<br>
'‘Movies with a runtime between 120 and 150 minutes tend to perform better commercially.’<br>
